</div><div>But wait, there's more...
</div><div>
</div><div>An offer this good would not be complete without a stack of drool inducing bonuses!
</div><div>So lets do this...
</div><div>{New} BONUS #1: Bi-Weekly Live "Classroom Style" Trainings + Surprise "Pop Up" Sessions (Value: Beyond Measure)
</div><div>module
</div><div>Listen... you're gonna get access to a ton of high quality marketing information via the above training portals. That's an undisputed fact. However, you know it and I know it, that a little thing called "Information Overload" is bound take over your brain. So... what we decided to do to help remove the overwhelm, the confusion, etc... is jump into a virtual (LIVE) "Classroom Style" training room with you and walk you by the hand... as to exactly how the big boys and girls are making the really (BIG) money!
</div><div>
</div><div>This is literally worth every penny (and then some) of your $250 admission ticket into the Fearless Momma program. And admittedly, can be removed at anytime, pending schedule and work flow, so best take advantage of this bonus while its still available.
</div><div>
</div><div>One time out of pocket for all of this...
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The real secret to wealth is being able 
</div><div>to do MORE in less time...
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>{New} BONUS #2: Private Facebook Community (Value: $197/mo)
</div><div>Included with your new Fearless Momma membership, is our clients only Facebook Group, where you'll get first access to new (LIVE) trainings, email swipes, marketing ideas, etc.. Plus you'll be able to get support, and have your questions answered, openly and honestly by your fellow Fearless members.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>BONUS #3: Can This Simple (3) Part Equation Really Make You A Millionaire? (Value: $99)
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Inside, we pull back the curtain on how success boils down to basically 2 parts. When you're moving forward with these 2 parts in hand, success is virtually guaranteed.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>BONUS #4: Amateur vs Professional - 
</div><div>Who wins the pot of gold? (Value: $99)
</div><div>The stone cold facts are this... you have those who make money online and you have those who don't. Obviously, those who are making the money are doing something that those who are not making money are not doing. The above is pretty much a "DUH" statement but one that represents a major divide, between the haves and the have nots.
</div><div>
</div><div>So let's do something about it, shall we? How about a 8:41 video that reveals the (1) thing a professional money maker is doing that the amateur money maker is completely clueless about.
</div><div>
</div><div>This (1) video, if you watch nothing else, is a game changer.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>BONUS #5: How to leverage 
</div><div>O.P.M. to your favor (Value: $497)
</div><div>The rich have known something for years and it's this... When you want to spend money, spend someone else's!
</div><div>
</div><div>Inside this bonus module, I go deep into credit territory, showing you how you can start using O.P.M. (Other People's Money) to get what you want!
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>BONUS #6: How to travel the world, sleep in 5-star villas and (STILL) collect big, fat checks in the mail! (Value: $297)
</div><div>This is my favorite bonus of them all!
</div><div>
</div><div>Being able to travel (have freedom), being able to sleep in 5 star resorts (like the rich and famous) and still be able to produce an income (no financial stress) is living a truly blessed life.
</div><div>
</div><div>One that is within your grasp (IF) you open yourself up to a new set of ideas and money making information that contradicts probably everything you've seen and heard to date. But just give me 6 minutes of your time and I will open a new set of doors for you that you thought could never have been opened.
</div><div>
</div><div>As you can imagine, delivering and 
</div><div>maintaining these bonuses is a (HUGE) responsibility of ours.
</div><div>

</div><div>
</div><div>Frequently Asked Questions
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: Do I have to any prior experience?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: No, you do not. Most of our customers are individuals who are new to the online marketing arena, make money niche. So there's no prior skills or experience
</div><div>needed.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: Do I have to buy Fearless Momma for $250 to make the $250?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: Yes. Basically what you're getting is a resell license to market and utilize the Fearless Momma system, products and 100% commission structure.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: I like stuff that's free. Do you have anything that's free?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: Sure. The initial training video that taught you how to make your 1st $250 in 72 hours. That was free.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: I've been burned in MLM programs, gifting scams, etc.. why is this any different?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: I too, have been a part of a variety of programs and systems that didn't work out, for whatever reason. Some were downright scams, others were not. So I can certainly understand your skepticism. However, here's what you need to think about... not everything out there is a scam. There are a lot of good programs and systems available that can help you make the money and give you the freedom you're seeking.
</div><div>
</div><div>Fearless Momma is one of the good ones. We deliver a quality product and a great system that can be easily set up to produce results in days, not weeks and above all else, we actually (SUPPORT) our customers, to help them get the success they want.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: Do I have to spend my day doing Facebook lives, posting videos, chatting up strangers to buy on social media?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: Absolutely not! We use powerful, 100 + year old direct response marketing principles to attract and collect the money we make. Besides, we have families, kids, other responsibilities, etc... so expecting others to have the time to sit around and post all day isn't in our framework.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: I don't have $250. I'm broke, behind on rent. What can I do?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: Get a job. Get your finances in order, and then come back online.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: Am I guaranteed to make money with this program?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: No, you are not. There are no guarantee of income, given or implied. Anyone who does guarantee you money, is a huckster and a scam artist, because not only is it illegal to make such income claims, it's also unethical.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: At the end of the day, all I want is to be able to provide for my family, pay my bills, take a vacation or two, and genuinely not have to worry about money anymore. Is that too much to ask for?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: No. Because that's exactly what we wanted too when we started out online. And the good news is, is that the money you want, is available to you. All you have to do is position yourself in front of it, and let it come to you.
</div><div>
</div><div>Sounds so simple, yet so unbelievable at the same time, I know. But it's the truth.
</div><div>
</div><div>Question: I'm looking for 1:1 'hand holding' because honestly I'm so new to this stuff that I have no clue where to start. Can I get that here?
</div><div>
</div><div>Answer: No. Not for $250 one time. If you're looking for true 1:1 coaching / mentorship, while available, will cost you upwards of $5,000. What is a great alternative are the bi-weekly live trainings (See Bonus #1 above), as well as, the recordings of the past masterminds.
</div><div>
</div><div>The masterminds have 100 + members on each of them, and with that level of diversity, a lot of questions are covered that will surely assist you so you can get the best results in the least amount of time, for a fraction of the cost.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>$22K and counting...
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Making money (WHILE) you sleep = A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I've heard enough. I'm ready to get started. 
</div><div>I've got nothing to lose and a new future to create.
