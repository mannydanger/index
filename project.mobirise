Most of our customers are individuals who are new to the online marketing arena, make money niche. So there's no prior skills or experience\n</div><div>needed.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to buy Fearless Momma for $250 to make the $250?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Yes. Basically what you're getting is a resell license to market and utilize the Fearless Momma system, products and 100% commission structure.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I like stuff that's free. Do you have anything that's free?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Sure. The initial training video that taught you how to make your 1st $250 in 72 hours. That was free.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I've been burned in MLM programs, gifting scams, etc.. why is this any different?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: I too, have been a part of a variety of programs and systems that didn't work out, for whatever reason. Some were downright scams, others were not. So I can certainly understand your skepticism. However, here's what you need to think about... not everything out there is a scam. There are a lot of good programs and systems available that can help you make the money and give you the freedom you're seeking.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Fearless Momma is one of the good ones. We deliver a quality product and a great system that can be easily set up to produce results in days, not weeks and above all else, we actually (SUPPORT) our customers, to help them get the success they want.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to spend my day doing Facebook lives, posting videos, chatting up strangers to buy on social media?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Absolutely not! We use powerful, 100 + year old direct response marketing principles to attract and collect the money we make. Besides, we have families, kids, other responsibilities, etc... so expecting others to have the time to sit around and post all day isn't in our framework.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I don't have $250. I'm broke, behind on rent. What can I do?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Get a job. Get your finances in order, and then come back online.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Am I guaranteed to make money with this program?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No, you are not. There are no guarantee of income, given or implied. Anyone who does guarantee you money, is a huckster and a scam artist, because not only is it illegal to make such income claims, it's also unethical.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: At the end of the day, all I want is to be able to provide for my family, pay my bills, take a vacation or two, and genuinely not have to worry about money anymore. Is that too much to ask for?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No. Because that's exactly what we wanted too when we started out online. And the good news is, is that the money you want, is available to you. All you have to do is position yourself in front of it, and let it come to you.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Sounds so simple, yet so unbelievable at the same time, I know. But it's the truth.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I'm looking for 1:1 'hand holding' because honestly I'm so new to this stuff that I have no clue where to start.

Most of our customers are individuals who are new to the online marketing arena, make money niche. So there's no prior skills or experience\n</div><div>needed.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to buy Fearless Momma for $250 to make the $250?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Yes. Basically what you're getting is a resell license to market and utilize the Fearless Momma system, products and 100% commission structure.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I like stuff that's free. Do you have anything that's free?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Sure. The initial training video that taught you how to make your 1st $250 in 72 hours. That was free.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I've been burned in MLM programs, gifting scams, etc.. why is this any different?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: I too, have been a part of a variety of programs and systems that didn't work out, for whatever reason. Some were downright scams, others were not. So I can certainly understand your skepticism. However, here's what you need to think about... not everything out there is a scam. There are a lot of good programs and systems available that can help you make the money and give you the freedom you're seeking.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Fearless Momma is one of the good ones. We deliver a quality product and a great system that can be easily set up to produce results in days, not weeks and above all else, we actually (SUPPORT) our customers, to help them get the success they want.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to spend my day doing Facebook lives, posting videos, chatting up strangers to buy on social media?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Absolutely not! We use powerful, 100 + year old direct response marketing principles to attract and collect the money we make. Besides, we have families, kids, other responsibilities, etc... so expecting others to have the time to sit around and post all day isn't in our framework.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I don't have $250. I'm broke, behind on rent. What can I do?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Get a job. Get your finances in order, and then come back online.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Am I guaranteed to make money with this program?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No, you are not. There are no guarantee of income, given or implied. Anyone who does guarantee you money, is a huckster and a scam artist, because not only is it illegal to make such income claims, it's also unethical.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: At the end of the day, all I want is to be able to provide for my family, pay my bills, take a vacation or two, and genuinely not have to worry about money anymore. Is that too much to ask for?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No. Because that's exactly what we wanted too when we started out online. And the good news is, is that the money you want, is available to you. All you have to do is position yourself in front of it, and let it come to you.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Sounds so simple, yet so unbelievable at the same time, I know. But it's the truth.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I'm looking for 1:1 'hand holding' because honestly I'm so new to this stuff that I have no clue where to start. Can I get that here?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No. Not for $250 one time. If you're looking for true 1:1 coaching / mentorship, while available, will cost you upwards of $5,000. What is a great alternative are the bi-weekly live trainings (See Bonus #1 above), as well as, the recordings of the past masterminds.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>The masterminds have 100 + members on each of them, and with that level of diversity, a lot of questions are covered that will surely assist you so you can get the best results in the least amount of time, for a fraction of the cost.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>$22K and counting...\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Making money (WHILE) you sleep = A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>I've heard enough.

Most of our customers are individuals who are new to the online marketing arena, make money niche. So there's no prior skills or experience\n</div><div>needed.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to buy Fearless Momma for $250 to make the $250?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Yes. Basically what you're getting is a resell license to market and utilize the Fearless Momma system, products and 100% commission structure.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I like stuff that's free. Do you have anything that's free?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Sure. The initial training video that taught you how to make your 1st $250 in 72 hours. That was free.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I've been burned in MLM programs, gifting scams, etc.. why is this any different?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: I too, have been a part of a variety of programs and systems that didn't work out, for whatever reason. Some were downright scams, others were not. So I can certainly understand your skepticism. However, here's what you need to think about... not everything out there is a scam. There are a lot of good programs and systems available that can help you make the money and give you the freedom you're seeking.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Fearless Momma is one of the good ones. We deliver a quality product and a great system that can be easily set up to produce results in days, not weeks and above all else, we actually (SUPPORT) our customers, to help them get the success they want.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to spend my day doing Facebook lives, posting videos, chatting up strangers to buy on social media?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Absolutely not! We use powerful, 100 + year old direct response marketing principles to attract and collect the money we make. Besides, we have families, kids, other responsibilities, etc... so expecting others to have the time to sit around and post all day isn't in our framework.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I don't have $250. I'm broke, behind on rent. What can I do?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Get a job. Get your finances in order, and then come back online.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Am I guaranteed to make money with this program?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No, you are not. There are no guarantee of income, given or implied. Anyone who does guarantee you money, is a huckster and a scam artist, because not only is it illegal to make such income claims, it's also unethical.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: At the end of the day, all I want is to be able to provide for my family, pay my bills, take a vacation or two, and genuinely not have to worry about money anymore. Is that too much to ask for?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No. Because that's exactly what we wanted too when we started out online. And the good news is, is that the money you want, is available to you. All you have to do is position yourself in front of it, and let it come to you.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Sounds so simple, yet so unbelievable at the same time, I know. But it's the truth.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I'm looking for 1:1 'hand holding' because honestly I'm so new to this stuff that I have no clue where to start. Can I get that here?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No. Not for $250 one time. If you're looking for true 1:1 coaching / mentorship, while available, will cost you upwards of $5,000. What is a great alternative are the bi-weekly live trainings (See Bonus #1 above), as well as, the recordings of the past masterminds.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>The masterminds have 100 + members on each of them, and with that level of diversity, a lot of questions are covered that will surely assist you so you can get the best results in the least amount of time, for a fraction of the cost.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>$22K and counting...\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Making money (WHILE) you sleep = A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>I've heard enough.

Most of our customers are individuals who are new to the online marketing arena, make money niche. So there's no prior skills or experience\n</div><div>needed.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to buy Fearless Momma for $250 to make the $250?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Yes. Basically what you're getting is a resell license to market and utilize the Fearless Momma system, products and 100% commission structure.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I like stuff that's free. Do you have anything that's free?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Sure. The initial training video that taught you how to make your 1st $250 in 72 hours. That was free.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I've been burned in MLM programs, gifting scams, etc.. why is this any different?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: I too, have been a part of a variety of programs and systems that didn't work out, for whatever reason. Some were downright scams, others were not. So I can certainly understand your skepticism. However, here's what you need to think about... not everything out there is a scam. There are a lot of good programs and systems available that can help you make the money and give you the freedom you're seeking.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Fearless Momma is one of the good ones. We deliver a quality product and a great system that can be easily set up to produce results in days, not weeks and above all else, we actually (SUPPORT) our customers, to help them get the success they want.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Do I have to spend my day doing Facebook lives, posting videos, chatting up strangers to buy on social media?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Absolutely not! We use powerful, 100 + year old direct response marketing principles to attract and collect the money we make. Besides, we have families, kids, other responsibilities, etc... so expecting others to have the time to sit around and post all day isn't in our framework.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I don't have $250. I'm broke, behind on rent. What can I do?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: Get a job. Get your finances in order, and then come back online.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: Am I guaranteed to make money with this program?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No, you are not. There are no guarantee of income, given or implied. Anyone who does guarantee you money, is a huckster and a scam artist, because not only is it illegal to make such income claims, it's also unethical.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: At the end of the day, all I want is to be able to provide for my family, pay my bills, take a vacation or two, and genuinely not have to worry about money anymore. Is that too much to ask for?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No. Because that's exactly what we wanted too when we started out online. And the good news is, is that the money you want, is available to you. All you have to do is position yourself in front of it, and let it come to you.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Sounds so simple, yet so unbelievable at the same time, I know. But it's the truth.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Question: I'm looking for 1:1 'hand holding' because honestly I'm so new to this stuff that I have no clue where to start. Can I get that here?\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Answer: No. Not for $250 one time. If you're looking for true 1:1 coaching / mentorship, while available, will cost you upwards of $5,000. What is a great alternative are the bi-weekly live trainings (See Bonus #1 above), as well as, the recordings of the past masterminds.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>The masterminds have 100 + members on each of them, and with that level of diversity, a lot of questions are covered that will surely assist you so you can get the best results in the least amount of time, for a fraction of the cost.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>$22K and counting...\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Making money (WHILE) you sleep = A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>I've heard enough.
